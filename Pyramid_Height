''' 
Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.
Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. 
The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.
Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer,
they finish their work immediately.
'''
blocks = int(input("Enter the blocks:"))

height = 0 
pyramid = 1 
while pyramid <= blocks:
    height += 1 
    blocks -= pyramid 
    pyramid += 1 
print("The height of pyramid is:", height)
